# Introduction to MCP Server

## Overview

The GitHub MCP Server is a hosted, secure, scalable way to integrate your favorite GitHub features into your AI-assisted workflow. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic, it's compatible with all of your favorite development tools. This module introduces GitHub MCP Server and teaches you how to configure it in VS Code, use it with Copilot Chat, and troubleshoot common issues.

**Module Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Level**: Intermediate

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand what MCP and GitHub MCP Server are and why they're useful for developers
- Set up and configure GitHub MCP Server in Visual Studio Code for your projects
- Use the GitHub MCP Server with Copilot Chat to automate development tasks
- Identify and resolve common issues when working with GitHub MCP Server

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- Visual Studio Code or another editor that supports MCP integration
- If you're a member of an organization or enterprise with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy must be enabled
- (Optional) A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for advanced setup and permissions control
- (Optional) Docker installed if you plan to experiment with a local server setup

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is like a USB-C standard for your AI tools, providing a consistent and secure way for AI models to connect to the tools and data sources they need.

### MCP Offers

- **Access to a growing library of tools** that your AI models can use immediately
- **Flexibility to work with different AI providers** while keeping your workflows consistent
- **Integration into your existing development environment** and processes

### How MCP Clients Connect to Servers and Services

There are three common ways that an MCP Client (such as Claude, an IDE, or another tool) can interact with MCP Servers:

**1. Local communication with local data (top path)**

The MCP Client talks directly to an MCP Server running on your machine using the MCP Protocol. That server then connects to a local data source (files, databases, or other resources stored on your computer).

**When to use it**: This setup is useful for local development, or anytime you want fast access to data that stays private on your machine.

**2. Local server as a bridge to remote services (middle path)**

The MCP Client connects to an MCP Server running locally, but instead of working only with local data, this server bridges to a remote service on the internet by calling its Web APIs.

**When to use it**: This model is common when a local tool needs to fetch or update information from a remote service but benefits from having a local server in between—for example, to handle caching, security checks, or data preprocessing.

**3. Remote communication over the internet (bottom path)**

The MCP Client connects to an MCP Server that lives entirely on the internet (not on your machine). That remote server then communicates with other external services via Web APIs.

**When to use it**: This approach is best when the resource or computation you need can't happen locally—like using cloud-based compute, SaaS platforms, or third-party integrations that only exist online.

## Why Use GitHub MCP Server?

Using local MCP servers typically requires Docker, token management, and manual configuration, which can slow down your setup and block integration with web clients like GitHub.com.

### Benefits of GitHub MCP Server

GitHub MCP Server offers:

- **Eliminates the need for Docker or manual configuration files**
- **Provides easy one-click OAuth login** for fast authentication
- **Allows you to work seamlessly across web, desktop, and mobile** environments
- **Supports enterprise identity providers** such as Entra and Auth0 for secure authentication
- **Scales automatically** to meet your usage needs

### GitHub MCP Server in Action

GitHub MCP Server is an open-source server that connects GitHub Copilot and other AI tools directly to your repositories. It allows you to:

- Analyze and summarize your code to better understand your projects
- Create and manage issues and pull requests
- Automate repository triage and task tracking to save time

**Currently, GitHub MCP Server offers over 30 tools**, enabling you to:

- Add issues, edit files, and create branches easily
- Rank pull requests and issues to identify priorities

## Configuring GitHub MCP Server in VS Code

### Setup Using OAuth

**Step 1**: In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).

**Step 2**: Type `MCP: add server` and press Enter.

**Step 3**: From the list, select `HTTP (HTTP or Server-Sent Events)`.

**Step 4**: In the Server URL field, enter `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`, then press Enter.

**Step 5**: When prompted to enter a Server ID, you can press Enter to use the default or type a custom ID if you prefer.

**Step 6**: Choose where you would like to save your MCP Server configuration. You can add it to your user settings to use across all projects or to your workspace settings for the current project.

**Step 7**: A prompt will appear asking you to authorize with GitHub using OAuth. Select Allow and sign in to your GitHub account if prompted.

After setup, GitHub MCP Server will be ready to use with your projects in VS Code. You can now start using AI-powered tools and workflows to automate tasks, manage issues, and analyze your code directly within your editor.

### Setup Using Personal Access Token (PAT)

For advanced control using a Personal Access Token:

**Step 1**: Create a PAT with `repo` and `read:packages` scope in your GitHub account.

**Step 2**: Follow the same steps as OAuth setup, but cancel OAuth when prompted.

**Step 3**: In your configuration file, add:

```json
"headers": {
  "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_token}"
}
```

**Step 4**: Add an input prompt to securely enter your token:

```json
"inputs": [
  {
    "id": "github_token",
    "type": "promptString",
    "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
    "password": true
  }
]
```

**Step 5**: Restart the MCP server in VS Code and enter your PAT when prompted.

### Local MCP Server Setup with Docker (Optional)

If your enterprise uses GitHub Enterprise Server with PAT restrictions, you can run the MCP Server locally.

**Requirements:**
- Docker installed and running on your system
- A PAT with the necessary scopes

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "github_token",
      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the MCP server and enter your PAT when prompted to complete the setup.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using GitHub MCP Server:

- **Confirm that you're signed into your GitHub account** within VS Code
- **If using a PAT, ensure it has the correct scopes** and is entered correctly
- **Double-check your configuration** for any typos or missing fields
- **If using Docker, ensure it's installed** and actively running
- **Try restarting VS Code or the MCP Server** to resolve temporary connection issues

## Using GitHub MCP Server with Copilot Chat

### Getting Started

**Step 1**: Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code and switch to Agent mode to activate the MCP Server tools.

**Step 2**: Click on "Select tools" to view all the available MCP Server functionalities.

**Step 3**: You can now try creating a new issue, summarizing a repository, or getting insights into your work using natural language prompts.

**Step 4**: Follow the prompts within Copilot Chat to complete your tasks efficiently.

### Copilot's Agentic Capabilities and MCP

#### What Are Agentic Capabilities?

Agentic capabilities give Copilot the ability to:

- **Work independently** by carrying out multi-step workflows without needing constant guidance
- **Make decisions** by choosing which tools or approaches to use based on the context it has
- **Adapt and improve** by responding to feedback, adjusting its approach, and iterating on results

In other words, agent mode allows Copilot to handle tasks in a way that feels more autonomous, almost like having a teammate who understands the bigger picture rather than just following individual instructions.

#### How MCP Makes Agent Mode Stronger

On its own, agent mode is powerful. But when you add MCP servers, you give Copilot the ability to reach beyond the immediate coding environment. Through MCP, Copilot can:

- **Access external data, APIs, or enterprise tools** directly
- **Stay in context across multiple platforms**, without requiring you to switch applications
- **Complete "agentic loops"**, where it dynamically seeks information, analyzes results, and makes informed next steps

This means Copilot isn't just reacting to a single prompt. Instead, it's working in a cycle: exploring, adapting, and refining until it produces the outcome you want.

#### Benefits of Combining MCP with Agent Mode

When you bring these two capabilities together, you unlock key advantages:

- **Extended context**: Copilot can draw on information from multiple systems, not just your code editor
- **Reduced manual effort**: Routine work like opening issues, managing workflows, or running checks can be automated
- **Seamless integration**: Copilot can carry out tasks that span tools and platforms

### Best Practices for Success

To get the most from MCP and agent mode:

1. **Be clear about goals**: Define what you want Copilot to achieve, and what the final output should look like
2. **Provide context**: Share background details about your project or workflow
3. **Set boundaries**: If you want Copilot to stop at planning (and not make changes yet), state that
4. **Ask for confirmation**: Before big changes, have Copilot summarize its plan so you can approve or refine it
5. **Use prompt files or instructions**: Create custom prompt files that guide Copilot on how to behave with specific MCP servers
