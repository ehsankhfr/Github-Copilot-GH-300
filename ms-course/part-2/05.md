## Introduction

GitHub Copilot analyzes your file and related files, offering suggestions in your text editor. It uses OpenAI Codex, a new AI system developed by OpenAI, to help derive context from written code and comments, and then suggests new lines or entire functions.

GitHub Codespaces is a hosted developer environment operating in the cloud that can be run with Visual Studio Code. You can customize the development experience for any development project on GitHub, preinstalling dependencies, libraries, and even Visual Studio Code extensions and settings.

### Scenario: Improving a Project

As a developer, you want to be more productive typing code faster both for new projects and existing ones. For this task, you hope that an AI assistant is what you need to improve your developer workflows in code writing, documentation, testing and more.

In this module, you'll understand how you can use GitHub Copilot with applied examples modifying a repository using a prompt to customize scroll behavior and live suggestions after typing initial code.

### What Will You Learn?

By the conclusion of this module, you'll acquire the skills to:

- Configure a GitHub repository in Codespaces and install GitHub Copilot extension
- Craft prompts to generate suggestions from GitHub Copilot
- Apply GitHub Copilot to improve your projects

### Main Objective

After successfully finishing this module, you'll be capable of using a prompt to customize a JavaScript project with GitHub Copilot in GitHub Codespaces.

## What is GitHub Copilot?

When writing code, you often consult documentation or web pages to remember syntax or solve problems. You might spend hours fixing issues, writing tests, and creating documentation. These tasks are time-consuming. Using code snippets or IDE tools can help, but is there a better way?

### How Does It Work?

GitHub Copilot is an AI assistant that you use from within your IDE that's capable of generating code and much more. GitHub Copilot uses prompts—natural language text—and it provides suggestions based on what you type.

A prompt can, for example, be a comment within your code file:

```javascript
// Create a web API using express and JavaScript with routes for products and customers
```

Copilot then goes on to generate a response that you can choose to accept or reject. A response to the prompt could look similar to the following code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");

app = express();
app.path("/products", () => "products");
app.listen(3000, () => "app runs");
```

### How It Recognizes Prompts

Copilot can recognize a prompt or instruction if you:

- Type it as a comment in a code file (for example, `.py`, `.js`)
- Type text in a markdown file and wait a few seconds for Copilot to respond

### Accepting Suggestions

What you get from Copilot is a suggestion, which appears as grey text if you use black as your text color. To accept the suggestion, press the **Tab** key.

Copilot might suggest multiple options. To cycle through suggestions, use **Ctrl + Enter** and select the most appropriate one.

## Setting Up GitHub Copilot

### How to Set Up GitHub Copilot

To use GitHub Copilot, you need to complete the following steps:

**1. GitHub Account**

Create a GitHub account. Since Copilot is a GitHub service, you need a GitHub account to use it. If you don't have an account, visit the GitHub webpage to create one for free.

**2. Sign Up and Enable GitHub Copilot**

You can set up a GitHub Copilot Free account or sign up for a subscription to GitHub Copilot Pro trial with a one-time 30-day trial. For learning purposes, the Copilot Free option with usage limits should be sufficient.

> **Important**: If you choose the free trial offer for GitHub Copilot, a form of payment is requested at sign-up. Charges aren't applied until the trial is over, unless you cancel before the conclusion of the 30-day period.

> **Tip**: GitHub Copilot offers a free tier with 2,000 code autocompletes and 50 chat messages per month. To get started, open Visual Studio Code, click on the GitHub Copilot icon, and then click "Sign in to Use GitHub Copilot for Free". Log in to your GitHub account in the window that opens in the browser. Educators, Students, and select open-source maintainers can receive Copilot Pro for free.

**3. Install the Extension**

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension for major IDEs, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, VIM, and XCode.

To install, search for "GitHub Copilot" in your IDE's extension marketplace and follow the installation instructions. For example, in the VS Code marketplace, you find GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat, and GitHub Copilot for Azure as options to install.

### Environment Setup

First you need to launch the Codespaces environment, which comes preconfigured with the GitHub Copilot extension.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Codespace with the preconfigured environment
2. On the Create codespace page, review the codespace configuration settings and then select "Create new codespace"
3. Wait for the codespace to start (this startup process can take a few minutes)
4. The remaining exercises take place in the context of this development container

> **Important**: All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances.

### JavaScript Portfolio

When complete, Codespaces loads with a terminal section at the bottom. Codespaces installs all the required extensions and dependencies in your container. Once complete, this template is configured to use `npm start` to start the web application within your Codespace.

When the web application has successfully started, a message in the terminal shows that the server is running on port 1234 within your Codespace.

## Using GitHub Copilot with JavaScript

In previous sections, we showed how to set up Copilot and mentioned how it can make you faster as a developer starting to write code.

Now, let's discuss how Copilot can help you with existing projects and with more complicated tasks.

### Developing with GitHub Copilot

Often when we build out projects, we need to continuously ensure our code is fresh and updated. Additionally, we might need to fix any bugs that come up or add new features to improve functionality and usability. Let's explore some ways to make updates with GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat, an interactive chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to code-related questions.

### Prompt Engineering

Although GitHub Copilot can suggest code as you type, you can also build prompts to create useful suggestions. A prompt, which is our input, is a collection of instructions or guidelines that help generate code. A prompt is useful to generate specific responses from Copilot.

The quality of output from Copilot is dependent on how well you craft your prompt. Creating an effective prompt is essential for achieving desired outcomes.

**Poor prompt example:**

```javascript
// Create an API endpoint
```

Since the prompt is ambiguous and vague, the result from GitHub Copilot might not be what you need. For example, it could use a framework that you don't know, or an endpoint that requires data that you don't recognize.

**Better prompt example:**

```javascript
// Create an API endpoint using the React framework that accepts a JSON payload in a POST request
```

This prompt is specific, clear, and allows GitHub Copilot to understand the goal and scope of the task. Although you can also provide context and examples to Copilot using comments or code, you can also use the chat option of GitHub Copilot Chat. Having a good prompt ensures that the model generates a high-quality output.

### Best Practices Using GitHub Copilot

Copilot supercharges your productivity but requires some good practices to ensure quality.

**1. Keep prompts simple, then elaborate**

Start with:
```
create an HTML form with a text field and button
```

Next, elaborate more on the prompt to get more specific suggestions:
```
Add an event listener to the button to send a POST request to /generate endpoint and display response in a div with id "result"
```

**2. Cycle between suggestions**

You can do this using **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on a Mac). You get various suggestions from Copilot, and you can pick the best output. Optionally, when using GitHub Copilot Chat, you can use the chat input to add your prompt and interact with the output.

**3. Reword or start coding if stuck**

If you're stuck or not getting the results you want, then you can reword the prompt or start writing code for Copilot to autocomplete.

> **Note**: GitHub Copilot uses open files in your text editor as additional context. This is helpful because it provides useful information in addition to the prompt or code you may be writing. If you need GitHub Copilot to provide suggestions based on other files, you can open those or use @workspace with your prompt when using GitHub Copilot Chat.

## Exercise: Updating a JavaScript Portfolio

Let's explore how you can use code suggestions from GitHub Copilot. In this exercise, you add animations with live suggestions and use a prompt to customize scroll behavior from an already existing JavaScript template repository.

### JavaScript Portfolio

Whether you're a student, recent graduate, or an experienced professional, your portfolio is your personal space to showcase your skills and experience. Having a portfolio provides credibility and notoriety to the experience you're mentioning in your resume when applying for jobs.

In this template portfolio, we have a React-based web application ready for you to easily customize and deploy using only your web browser.

### Customizing Your JavaScript Portfolio

Before starting, you can customize the portfolio with your own links. Go to `src/App.jsx` and update the `siteProps` with your information:

```javascript
const siteProps = {
  name: "Alexandrie Grenier",
  title: "Web Designer & Content Creator",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  gitHub: "microsoft",
  instagram: "microsoft",
  linkedIn: "satyanadella",
  medium: "",
  twitter: "microsoft",
  youTube: "Code",
};
```

### Animating Social Media Icons with a Prompt

An animation can make the social media section more eye-catching. Ask Copilot's help to animate the icons. You can use GitHub Copilot Chat to ask Copilot or write the following prompt comment in the `src/styles.css` file:

```css
/* add an amazing animation to the social icons */
```

The suggestion from Copilot should look similar to the following:

```css
img.socialIcon:hover {
  animation: bounce 0.5s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

Accept the suggestion by pressing the tab key. If you don't receive the exact same suggestion, then you can either experiment with the suggestion provided or keep typing the CSS code until it matches.

Your site should already be running in your Codespace, and the change will reload onto the page automatically. To see the animation, hover over one of your social media icons in the footer!

Congratulations! Through the exercise, you haven't only used Copilot to generate code but also done it in an interactive and fun way! You can use GitHub Copilot to not only generate code, but write documentation, test your applications and more.
