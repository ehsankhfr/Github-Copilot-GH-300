### Key Factors for Selecting a Plan

When selecting a GitHub Copilot pricing plan, you and your organization should consider:

**Data Privacy and Security**: Business and Enterprise plans provide robust privacy controls including:
- Ability to exclude specific files from Copilot analysis
- Access to detailed audit logs
- IP indemnity protection

**Policy Management**: Business and Enterprise plans allow comprehensive policy management at the organizational level, ensuring sensitive data is handled according to privacy policies.

**Data Collection and Retention**: Individual subscribers can choose whether GitHub collects and retains their prompts and Copilot suggestions.

**IP Indemnity and Data Privacy**: For businesses and enterprises, these features are critical to avoiding legal, security, and customer issues.

**Tip**: GitHub Copilot offers a free tier with 2,000 code autocompletes and 50 chat messages per month. Educators, Students, and select open-source maintainers can receive Copilot Pro for free.

## 2. Contractual Protections and Public Code Filtering

To ensure your organization remains compliant with legal requirements, understanding contractual protections and GitHub Copilot features is essential.

### Contractual Protections

**IP Indemnity**: 
- Available in Business and Enterprise plans
- Provides legal protection against intellectual property claims
- GitHub assumes legal responsibility if suggestions are challenged as infringing on third-party IP rights
- **Requirement**: Matching public code setting must be blocked

**Data Protection Agreement (DPA)**:
- Outlines measures taken to protect your data
- Ensures compliance with data privacy regulations
- Provides transparency about secure data handling

**GitHub Copilot Trust Center**:
- Detailed information about how Copilot works
- Security, privacy, compliance documentation
- Intellectual property safeguards
- Best practices and legal requirements

### Filtering Out Matching Public Code

GitHub Copilot can help minimize potential code overlap by identifying and filtering out code suggestions that match publicly available code.

**Benefits**:
- Maintains originality and security of your codebase
- Reduces risk of incorporating nonsecure or noncompliant code
- Required for IP indemnity protection

**How to block suggestions matching public code**:

1. On the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo
2. Select **Your enterprises** or **Your organizations**
3. Next to the enterprise or organization, select **Settings**
4. On the left sidebar, select **Copilot**
5. Under **Suggestions**, select **Matching public code** on the dropdown menu
6. Select **Block**
7. Select **Save** to confirm

---

## 3. Managing Content Exclusions

The content exclusion feature helps protect sensitive information by preventing the use of specific files, directories, or repositories to inform code-completion suggestions.

### Configurations for Content Exclusion

#### Configure Content Exclusions for Repositories

1. On GitHub, go to the main page of the repository
2. Under the repository name, select **Settings**
3. In the sidebar, in the **Code & automation** section, select **Copilot**
4. In the **Repositories and paths to exclude** section, specify files or directories to exclude

#### Configure Content Exclusions for Organizations

1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo
2. Select **Your organizations**
3. Next to the organization, select **Settings**
4. On the left sidebar, select **Copilot > Content exclusion**
5. Enter the details of files or repositories to exclude

### Impact of Content Exclusion on Code Suggestions

When you exclude content from GitHub Copilot:

- **Code completion is no longer available** in the affected files
- **Content in affected files won't inform code completion** suggestions in other files
- **Content in affected files won't inform GitHub Copilot Chat** responses

**Considerations**:
- Can significantly affect quality and relevance of code suggestions
- Reduces overall context available to Copilot
- May affect accuracy and usefulness of suggestions
- Balance security with functionality

**Example**: Excluding a critical configuration file might prevent Copilot from suggesting relevant code snippets that depend on those configurations.

**Scope**: Content exclusion settings defined in an organization or repository apply to all members licensed as part of GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise subscriptions.

### Limitations of Content Exclusions

**IDE Limitations**: In some IDEs, content exclusions might not apply when using certain features like Copilot Chat. For example, in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, content exclusions are not applied when using the `@github` chat participant.

**Semantic Information**: Copilot might still use semantic information from an excluded file if the IDE provides the information in a non-excluded file. This includes:
- Type information
- Hover-over definitions for symbols
- Function calls used in code

**Policy Scope**: Content exclusion settings apply only to members of the organization where configured. Anyone else with access to the specified files can still see code completion suggestions and Copilot Chat responses referencing those files.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Problems

Let's explore common problems with GitHub Copilot and how to troubleshoot them.

### Code Suggestions Are Missing

If Copilot isn't providing code suggestions, try these actions:

**Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as Copilot requires an active connection to function.

**Update the Copilot Extension**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension. Older versions might not communicate effectively with Copilot servers.

**Verify IDE Compatibility**: Confirm that your IDE is compatible with GitHub Copilot. Some IDEs might require specific configurations or updates.

**Review Content Exclusions**: If certain files are excluded from Copilot analysis, suggestions might not appear. Check content exclusion settings.

### Content Exclusions Aren't Working as Expected

**Delayed Application of Exclusions**: After adding or changing content exclusions, changes can take up to 30 minutes to take effect in IDEs where settings are already loaded. To apply changes immediately, reload the content exclusion settings in your IDE.

**Inadequate Scope of Exclusions**: 
- Content exclusion settings apply only to members of the organization where configured
- Ensure all relevant team members have appropriate settings applied
- Check the GitHub Copilot icon on the status bar - if a diagonal line appears through it, an exclusion applies

**IDE-Specific Limitations**: In some IDEs, content exclusions might not apply when using certain features like GitHub Copilot Chat. Be aware of these limitations.

### Code Suggestions Are Unsatisfactory

Use these techniques to prompt Copilot for better results:

**Provide Clear Context**: Ensure your code provides clear context for GitHub Copilot. This includes writing descriptive comments and using meaningful variable names.

**Use Copilot Commands**: In some IDEs, use specific commands to prompt Copilot. For example, in Visual Studio Code, use `Ctrl+Enter` to trigger GitHub Copilot.

**Adjust Prompt Length**: Sometimes, providing a longer or more detailed prompt can help Copilot generate better suggestions. Experiment with different prompt lengths.
