## 4. Interacting with GitHub Copilot

### Inline Suggestions

The most immediate form of assistance in Copilot. As you type, Copilot analyzes your code and context to offer real-time code completions.

**How it works**:
- Suggestions appear as grayed-out text ahead of your cursor
- **Accept**: Press `Tab` or `→` (right arrow)
- **Reject**: Keep typing or press `Esc`

**Best for**: Repetitive tasks and quick boilerplate code

**Example**:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Start typing here and watch Copilot suggest the function body
```

### Command Palette

Provides quick access to various Copilot functions.

**How to use**:
- Open: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
- Type "Copilot" to see available commands
- Select actions like "Explain This" or "Generate Unit Tests"

### Copilot Chat

Interactive feature enabling natural language communication with Copilot.

**How to use**:
- Open the Copilot chat panel in your IDE
- Enter questions or requests in natural language
- Evaluate the Copilot response

**Example query**: "How do I implement a binary search in Python?"

**Example response**:
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
```

### Inline Chat

Context-specific conversations with Copilot directly within your code editor.

**How to use**:
- Place cursor where you want assistance
- Press `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+I` (Mac)
- Ask questions or request changes specific to that code location

### Slash Commands

Shortcuts for quick actions in Copilot:

- `/explain` - Provides an explanation of the selected code
- `/suggest` - Offers code suggestions based on current context
- `/tests` - Generates unit tests for selected function or class
- `/comment` - Converts comments into code snippets

**Usage**: Type the command in your editor and press Enter

### Comments to Code

Copilot uses natural language processing to convert comments into code.

**Example**:
```python
# Function to reverse a string
def reverse_string(s):
    # Copilot suggests the function body here
```

**Generated code**:
```python
# Function to reverse a string
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
```

### Multiple Suggestions

For complex code snippets, Copilot offers multiple alternatives.

**How to use**:
- Look for the light bulb icon when Copilot offers a suggestion
- Click the icon or use `Alt+]` (Windows/Linux) or `Option+]` (Mac) to cycle through alternatives

### Explanations

Use the "Explain This" feature to understand existing code.

**How to use**:
- Select a block of code
- Right-click and select "Copilot: Explain This"
- Read the explanation Copilot provides

### Automated Test Generation

Copilot can generate unit tests for your functions or classes.

**How to use**:
- Select a function or class
- Use command palette to select "Copilot: Generate Unit Tests"
- Review the suggested test cases

**Example**:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Copilot might generate a test like this:
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
```
