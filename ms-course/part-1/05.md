# Using Advanced GitHub Copilot Features

**Module**: GitHub Copilot Fundamentals Part 1 of 2  
**Duration**: 22 minutes  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Target Audience**: DevOps Engineers, Administrators, Developers, Solution Architects, Students

## Overview

This module teaches you how to use advanced GitHub Copilot features with a Python application. You'll learn to apply slash commands, interact using the Chat feature, and ask questions about your project using agents to enhance your developer workflows in code writing, documentation, and testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Apply slash commands to make code changes
- Interact with GitHub Copilot using the Chat feature
- Ask questions about your project using an agent

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python (variables and conditionals)
- Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control
- Access to the GitHub Copilot service

---

## 1. Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI coding partner that provides autocomplete suggestions while you code. Get suggestions by typing code or interactively using natural language.

### How Copilot Works

- Analyzes your file and related files
- Offers suggestions in your text editor
- Uses context from written code and comments
- Suggests new lines or entire functions

### GitHub Codespaces

A hosted developer environment operating in the cloud that can be run with Visual Studio Code. You can customize the development experience by preinstalling dependencies, libraries, and VS Code extensions.

### Scenario: Working with Existing Projects

As a developer, you want to be more productive by typing code faster for both new and existing projects. This module demonstrates using advanced Copilot features through applied examples: modifying a repository, adding HTTP API endpoints, writing unit tests, and documenting code.

## 2. Advanced GitHub Copilot Features

Often when working with code, you need to review project documentation, libraries, and framework documentation. Understanding the codebase is essential for writing code or documentation. Tasks like fixing bugs and writing tests can be time-intensive but necessary. GitHub Copilot's advanced features make these tasks easier and more efficient.

### The Basics

**Ghost Text**: When GitHub Copilot is enabled, it provides suggestions called ghost text.

**Actions**:
- **Ignore**: Continue typing or press `Esc`
- **Accept**: Press `Tab` key

**Context**: By default, GitHub Copilot uses the files you have open as context. You can also provide prompts using:
- Comments
- Chat window
- Inline chat within your code

### Chatting with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot allows interactive discussions using the chat feature.

**In Visual Studio Code**:
- Click the chat icon on the left sidebar
- Opens chat interface in a dedicated pane
- Ask questions about code you're working on
- Ask general software-related questions

### Using Inline Chat

Interact with GitHub Copilot without leaving your code.

**How to access**:
- Windows: `Ctrl+i`
- Mac: `Command+i`

**Benefits**:
- No context switching to different panes
- Suggestions and interactions happen closer to the code

### Slash Commands

Within the chat pane or inline chat, use slash commands for specific intents to quickly solve common development tasks.

**How to use**:
- Type a forward slash (`/`) in chat pane or inline chat
- See drop-down menu with all available slash commands

**Common slash commands**:
- `/tests` - Helps you write tests
- `/docs` - Intended for writing documentation
- `/fix` - Helps fix code issues
- `/explain` - Gets explanations about code
- `/generate` - Generates code to answer questions
- `/help` - Gets help on using Copilot chat
- `/optimize` - Analyzes and improves runtime of selected code

**Benefit**: Get better responses without writing longer prompts

### Agents

Visual Studio Code features called agents allow you to ask questions using specific context.

**Available agents**:

**@terminal**:
- Helps chat with GitHub Copilot to interact with the terminal
- Example: `@terminal How do I fix the error message I'm seeing?`

**@workspace**:
- Aware of your entire workspace
- Allows questions about the entire project
- Example: `@workspace how can I package this project?`

**@file**:
- Focuses on the content of a specific file
- Example: `@file Can you help me refactor this function in main.py?`

**@directory**:
- Considers the contents of a specific directory
- Example: `@directory How can I optimize the scripts in the utils directory?`

---

## 3. Applied GitHub Copilot Techniques

### Implicit Prompts

Take advantage of features that implicitly provide precrafted prompts to get good answers.

**Example**: Fixing a bug in Python code
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read the file and print the content
    contents = file.read
```

**Using `/fix` command**:
1. Select the code
2. Use `Ctrl+i` (Windows) or `Command+i` (Mac)
3. Type `/fix` in inline chat
4. Get response: "Add parentheses after file.read to call the read method"

### Most Useful Slash Commands

- `/doc` - Adds comments to specified or selected code
- `/explain` - Gets explanations about the code
- `/generate` - Generates code to answer specified question
- `/help` - Gets help on how to use Copilot chat
- `/optimize` - Analyzes and improves runtime of selected code
- `/tests` - Creates unit tests for selected code

### Selective Context

GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions based on specific context like entire workspace or terminal output.

**Example: Creating a Dockerfile**

Without opening many files, use `@workspace`:

```text
@workspace I need to create a Dockerfile for this project, can you generate one that will help me package it?
```

**More specific prompt**:
```text
@workspace help me create a Dockerfile to package this project but make sure you are using a Virtual Environment for Python.
```

**Note**: By default, GitHub Copilot uses open files in your text editor as additional context.

## 4. Setting Up GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code

### Environment Setup

1. Launch Codespaces environment (preconfigured with GitHub Copilot extension)
2. Open Codespace in browser
3. Review Codespace configuration settings
4. Select "Create new codespace"
5. Wait for Codespace to start (may take a few minutes)

**Important**: All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with two core instances.

### Python Web API

When complete:
- Codespaces loads with terminal section at bottom
- Installs all required extensions
- Executes uvicorn command to start web application
- Server runs on port 8000 within Codespace

### Sign Up for GitHub Copilot

If you haven't already:
- Set up free trial or subscription for your account
- Educators, Students, and select open-source maintainers can get Copilot Pro for free

## 5. Practical Exercise: Update a Web API

### What is an API?

An API acts as the intermediary that allows different applications to communicate. For example, a weather website can share historical data or provide forecast functionality through its API.

### Exercise Tasks

#### Step 1: Add a New Route

Open `main.py`, use inline chat (`Ctrl+i` or `Command+i`):

**Prompt**: 
```text
Create a new route that exposes the cities of a country/region.
```

**Expected result**:
```python
# Create a new route that exposes the cities of a country:
@app.get('/countries/{country}')
def cities(country: str):
    return list(data[country].keys())
```

#### Step 2: Create a Test

Select your code, use inline chat or dedicated chat pane:

**Prompt**:
```text
/tests help me to create a new test for this route that uses Spain as the country/region.
```

**If not working as expected, refine**:
```text
This test is not quite right, it is not including cities that doesn't exist. Only Seville is part of the API.
```

#### Step 3: Write Documentation

Use `@workspace` agent to write project documentation:

Open `README.md`, use prompt:
```text
@workspace I want to document how to run this project so that other developers can get started quickly by reading the README.md file.
```
