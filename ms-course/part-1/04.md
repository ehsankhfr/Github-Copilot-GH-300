# Introduction to Copilot Spaces

**Module**: GitHub Copilot Fundamentals Part 1 of 2  
**Duration**: 31 minutes  
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Target Audience**: DevOps Engineers, Administrators, Developers, Solution Architects

## Overview

GitHub Copilot Spaces provides a new way to work with AI by anchoring its responses in a carefully curated context. Unlike general Copilot Chat, which surfaces broad suggestions, a Space allows you to focus the model on specific files, issues, pull requests, and tailored instructions. This module guides developers and PMs to create, configure, and use Spaces effectively for high-quality, grounded responses.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners can:

- Explain what Spaces are and when to use them versus general Copilot Chat
- Create, configure, and iterate on a Space with targeted context and custom instructions
- Apply best practices for high-quality, grounded answers within model context limits

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with an active Copilot subscription
- Access to the Spaces feature in your environment (availability may vary)
- Basic familiarity with repositories, issues, and pull requests

---

## 1. What is a GitHub Copilot Space?

A **GitHub Copilot Space** is a dedicated Copilot chat grounded in a curated set of context you choose. The Space is itself like an LLM and you can feed it GitHub files, issues, pull requests, and your own free-text instructions to provide context to your specific topic.

### Key Differences from General Copilot Chat

| Feature | General Copilot Chat | Copilot Spaces |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Broad suggestions across codebase | Tightly scoped to curated context |
| **Context** | Automatically inferred | Manually curated by you |
| **Consistency** | Variable based on broad context | High consistency with focused context |
| **Use Case** | Exploration and discovery | Repeatable, domain-specific tasks |

### Why Tightly Scoped Context Improves Quality

Narrowing the context leads to:
- **More consistent answers**: Focused on specific domain knowledge
- **Reproducible responses**: Same context yields similar results
- **Better precision**: Less noise from irrelevant information
- **Predictable behavior**: Knows exactly what to reference

## 2. Setting Context for Copilot Spaces

The effectiveness of a Copilot Space depends on the context you provide. You can attach specific files, relevant issues or pull requests, and tailored instructions.

### Context Order Matters

Leading with the most critical files or instructions helps drive more accurate and relevant responses. The model prioritizes earlier context when generating answers.

### Attaching Files (Uploads)

**How to attach files**:
1. Use the "Attach files" or "Add context" button in Space setup
2. Select one or more files from your GitHub repository
3. Files can include: source code, markdown docs, configuration files, or other assets

**Key points**:
- Files are referenced from the **default branch**
- Your Space stays up to date as your repo evolves
- You may also upload files directly from your local machine (images, datasets) if allowed by workspace settings

### Adding Instructions

**How to add instructions**:
1. Use the "Instructions" section to provide specific guidance
2. Include goals: "Summarize the onboarding process"
3. Add style preferences: "Write in a formal tone"
4. Provide canonical examples: "Sample output should look like…"

**Best practices**:
- Keep instructions brief, focused, and actionable
- For workflow/troubleshooting guides, include step-by-step tasks
- Include sample prompts to guide expected interactions
- Update instructions at any time to refine focus

### When to Use GitHub Copilot Spaces

**Ideal scenarios**:
- Consistent, reproducible answers on tightly scoped topics
- Particular services, runbooks, or playbooks
- Known datasets requiring specific analysis
- Domain-specific documentation

**Trade-offs**:
- Spaces trade breadth for depth
- Narrowed context produces more predictable, grounded responses
- General chat surfaces wider discovery but may be less precise

### Practical Guidelines

**Keep Spaces small and focused**:
- Model context limits apply
- Avoid overwhelming the model with too much information

**Stay current**:
- Linked GitHub files reflect repository's default branch
- Content stays current as code evolves

**Be clear and concise**:
- Include a few canonical examples
- Anchor style and expected outputs
- Selection and ordering of context influences responses

## 3. Creating Your First Space

Creating a Space is simple but powerful—once named and configured, it becomes a reusable workspace where Copilot operates within a clearly defined scope.

### Steps to Create a Space

1. **Navigate** to https://github.com/copilot/spaces
2. **Click** "Create space"
3. **Give your space a name**
   - Choose a clear, descriptive name for discoverability
4. **Choose ownership**
   - Personal: Owned by you
   - Organization: Owned by an organization you belong to
   - Organization-owned Spaces can be shared using GitHub's built-in permission model
5. **Add a description** (optional)
   - Doesn't affect Copilot's responses
   - Helps others understand the Space's context
6. **Click Save**

**Note**: You can change the name and description at any time by clicking "Edit" in the top right corner.

### Adding Context to a Space

You can add two types of context:

#### 1. Instructions

Free text that describes what Copilot should focus on within this Space.

**Include**:
- Areas of expertise
- Types of tasks it should help with
- What it should avoid

**Purpose**: Helps Copilot give more relevant responses based on your intent.

#### 2. Attachments

Context used to provide more relevant answers. Spaces always refer to the latest version of code on the main branch.

**To add attachments**, click "Add" to the right of "Attachments", then choose from:

**Attach files and folders**:
- Add files and folders from GitHub repositories
- Includes code files, documentation, and other relevant content

**Link pull requests and issues**:
- Paste URLs of GitHub issues and pull requests

**Upload a file**:
- Upload files directly from your local machine
- Includes images, text files, rich documents, and spreadsheets

**Add text content**:
- Type or paste free-text content
- Examples: transcripts, notes, or any other relevant information

---

## 4. Sharing, Discoverability, and Governance

To ensure your Space delivers lasting value, it must be easy to find, securely shared, and well-maintained.

### Visibility and Sharing

**Successful Spaces are**:
- Easy to find
- Safe to share
- Clearly "owned"

**Setting visibility**:
- Personal ownership for individual use
- Organization visibility for team sharing
- Share by link or use org-level browsing/catalogs

**Best practices**:
- Use clear, purpose-driven titles
- Add short descriptions stating scope ("one job per Space")
- Define intended audience and expected outputs
- Teammates should immediately know when to use it

### Security and Access

**Key principles**:
- Security follows GitHub's existing permissions
- A Space doesn't grant new access
- Only surfaces content viewers are already entitled to see
- Private repo content requires appropriate permissions

**Best practice**: Avoid pasting sensitive data into free-text notes; prefer linking to version-controlled files where normal review and permissions apply.

### Versioning and Freshness

**How Spaces stay fresh**:
- Referenced live GitHub sources
- Linked files reflect repository's default branch
- Attached issues and pull requests evolve as they change
- Reduces need to copy content into separate documents

**For branch-specific guidance**:
- Narrow references to relevant files
- Add brief example in free text
- Attach text file with exact content (if supported)

### Governance

**Treat governance as lightweight but intentional**:

**Assign ownership**:
- Designate a maintainer responsible for updates

**Add usage guidance**:
- Include "How to use this Space" note
- Provide 1-3 canonical examples defining "good" output

**Establish naming conventions**:
- Example: "ServiceName—Onboarding Helper"
- Use consistent prefixes for discoverability

**Set review cadence**:
- Example: At each release
- Prune stale sources
- Keep instructions aligned with reality

**Split when necessary**:
- When Space grows beyond a single job
- Maintain high discoverability
- Preserve consistent answer quality

## 5. Best Practices: Do's and Don'ts of Working in a Space

### Do's

✅ **Keep questions tightly scoped** to attached sources (files, issues, pull requests, notes) so answers stay grounded

✅ **Treat Space as focused environment** for single task or domain; reuse its terminology for consistency

✅ **Use prompting patterns** that lead to runnable, verifiable outputs:
   - Confirm intent first
   - Refine with concrete constraints (formats, time ranges, file paths)
   - Ask for executable code, queries, or commands
   - Request references back to included sources for traceability

✅ **Iterate when responses drift**:
   - Tighten instructions
   - Add 1-3 high-quality examples
   - Prune noisy or irrelevant sources

✅ **Keep context fresh and well-ordered**:
   - Link version-controlled files
   - Lead with most important sources
   - Ordering influences responses

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't @-mention people or Copilot extensions** in a Space:
   - User mentions won't notify anyone
   - Extensions can't be invoked from Space chats

❌ **Don't expect Space to pull in content that isn't included**:
   - Unless environment supports repository search
   - Copilot won't discover outside material

❌ **Don't let Space sprawl** beyond single job or exceed model context limits:
   - Watch for size warnings or degraded answers
   - Reduce sources or split into smaller Spaces

❌ **Don't paste sensitive data** into free-text notes:
   - Prefer linking to files in repos
   - Use uploads where supported
   - Standard review and permissions apply
